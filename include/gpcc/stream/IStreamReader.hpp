/**
 * \brief Interface for decoding data from a binary stream.
 *
 * This is an abstract base class for subclasses offering read access to data streams:
 * - @ref MemStreamReader
 * - Classes offering read access to EEPROM sections
 * - Classes offering read access to files
 *
 * This is the opposite to class @ref IStreamWriter.
 *
 * # States of the stream
 * The stream can be in one of four states:
 * - @ref States::open
 * - @ref States::empty
 * - @ref States::closed
 * - @ref States::error
 *
 * The current state can be retrieved via @ref GetState().
 *
 * After instantiating a subclass of this class, the stream is usually in the _open_-state
 * and data can be read from it. The stream accepts read-accesses until it is either closed,
 * an error occurs, or until all available data has been read. A subclass is also allowed to
 * initialize the stream in the _empty_- or _error_-state.
 *
 * If all available data has been read, the stream will enter the _empty_-state.\n
 * If any error occurs during reading from the stream (either empty or not), it will enter
 * the _error_-state.\n
 * If the stream is closed, then it will enter the _closed_-state. The _closed_-state cannot be left.
 *
 * Any read access to a stream that is not in the _open_-state will fail, except zero bits/bytes are
 * requested to be read.
 *
 * # Closing a stream
 * _Before a stream instance can be released, it must be closed._
 *
 * It is recommended to invoke @ref Close() before releasing the stream object in order to close the
 * stream. If @ref Close() is not invoked, then the object's destructor will finally invoke it.
 *
 * If @ref Close() is invoked by the destructor and if the close-operation fails, then the application
 * will be terminated via @ref gpcc::osal::Panic(). It is therefore recommended to invoke @ref Close()
 * _before_ releasing the object. This also gives you the chance to catch potential exceptions.
 *
 * # Data Encoding
 * The data inside the stream is packed. There are no padding bytes included in the stream
 * to align the data elements to the natural alignment of their underlying types.
 *
 * Bit-based data inside the stream is packed on bit-level. If byte-based data follows after bit-
 * based data, then spare bits are expected in the stream which align the byte-based data to the
 * next byte-boundary if necessary.
 *
 * Data type `bool` is mapped to single bits inside the stream.
 *
 * Word-based data (16bit and above) can be decoded in little- or big-endian format. The
 * configured endianess can be retrieved via @ref GetEndian().
 *
 * # Reading bit-based data
 * The smallest piece of data that can be read from the stream is one byte. If bit-based data shall be
 * read from this interface, then one byte is read from the stream and the bits are retrieved by the read-
 * method. Bits included in the read byte that are not read are stored in a special intermediate storage
 * location. If further bits shall be read, then the data stored in the intermediate storage location is
 * used first before a new byte is read from the stream.
 *
 * This means:\n
 * When reading one bit, the stream's remaining number of bytes will be decremented.\n
 * Reading up to 7 further bits will not decrease the remaining number of bytes, because data from the
 * intermediate storage location will be used.
 *
 * If byte-based data is read after reading bit-based data, then the content of the intermediate storage
 * location will be discarded. This happens because any byte-based data must start on a byte-boundary.\n
 * Example:\n
 * After reading one bit and one byte from the stream, the stream's remaining number of bytes
 * will be decremented by 2.
 *
 * Invoking any read-method with number of elements to be read set to zero will not clear the
 * intermediate storage.
 *
 * # Remaining number of bytes
 * The remaining number of bytes that can be read from the stream is tracked by the subclass.
 * The currently remaining number of bytes can be retrieved via @ref RemainingBytes().
 *
 * __Note:__\n
 * - Some sub-classes are not capable to determine the remaining number of bytes. In these cases, @ref RemainingBytes()
 *   will throw. @ref IsRemainingBytesSupported() can be used to determine if the sub-class supports
 *   @ref RemainingBytes() or not.
 * - A stream with zero remaining bytes might have 7 bits that could still be read.
 * - @ref EnsureAllDataConsumed() can be used to check if the remaining number of bits meets the user's
 *   expectations.
 *
 * # Performance
 * Data is read from the stream byte by byte.
 *
 * Methods reading arrays of `uint8_t`, `int8_t`, and `char` provide a higher performance because they do
 * not need to care for the endianess of the read data. This allows sub-classes to use optimized copy
 * methods like memcpy.
