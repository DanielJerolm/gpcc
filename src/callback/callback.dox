/**
 * @ingroup GPCC
 * @defgroup GPCC_CALLBACK Callback
 *
 * \brief Tools for delivery of callbacks to clients.
 *
 * # Delivery of simple callback functions to multiple clients
 * Group @ref GPCC_CALLBACK contains the classes [MultiCallback](@ref gpcc::callback::MultiCallback),
 * [MultiCallbackSM](@ref gpcc::callback::MultiCallbackSM) and [ICallback](@ref gpcc::callback::ICallback)
 * which offer a mechanism for delivery of callbacks from an object to one or more
 * clients. Features:
 * - The callback function's signature can be specified through template parameters. Any number
 *   and (almost) any type of parameters can be passed to the client's callback implementation:
 *   + Simple data types (e.g. uint8_t) are OK
 *   + Pointers are OK
 *   + Referenced are not allowed
 *   + Objects could be passed by value, but this is not recommended
 * - Clients can register themselves if they are interested in a callback.
 * - Clients can unregister themselves if they are no longer interested in a callback.
 * - Build-in thread safety for callback registration, unregistration and invocation.
 *
 * The difference between the two classes is that class [MultiCallback](@ref gpcc::callback::MultiCallback)
 * contains its own mutex, while class [MultiCallbackSM](@ref gpcc::callback::MultiCallbackSM) needs an
 * externally supplied mutex. Usage of an externally supplied mutex allows multiple instances of class
 * [MultiCallbackSM](@ref gpcc::callback::MultiCallbackSM) to share the same mutex, which consumes
 * less resources, if multiple instances of class [MultiCallbackSM](@ref gpcc::callback::MultiCallbackSM)
 * are used.
 *
 * ## Example
 * The following example shows an class `Server`, which offers two events. Class `Client` registers
 * itself for the events. Note that both event's callbacks have different signature.
 *
 * ~~~{.cpp}
 * class Server
 * {
 *   public:
 *     ICallback<uint32_t, uint8_t>& AbcEvent(void) const { return &abcEvent; }
 *     ICallback<>& XyzEvent(void) const { return &xyzEvent; }
 *
 *   private:
 *     MultiCallback<uint32_t, uint8_t> mutable abcEvent;
 *     MultiCallback<> mutable xyzEvent;
 *
 *     void DoSomething(void)
 *     {
 *       if (some event)
 *         abcEvent.Notify(55,12);
 *       if (some other event)
 *         xyzEvent.Notify();
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * class Client
 * {
 *   public:
 *     Client(Server const & _srv)
 *     : srv(_srv)
 *     {
 *       srv.AbcEvent.Register(this, std::bind(Client::MyCallback1, this,
 *                                             std::placeholders::_1, std::placeholders::_2));
 *       srv.XyzEvent.Register(this, std::bind(Client::MyCallback2, this));
 *     }
 *     ~Client(void)
 *     {
 *       srv.AbcEvent().Unregister(this);
 *       srv.XyzEvent().Unregister(this);
 *     }
 *
 *   private:
 *     Server const & srv;
 *
 *     void MyCallback1(uint32_t p1, uint8_t p2)
 *     {
 *       // this is invoked in the context of "srv" if "abcEvent" occurrs in "srv".
 *     }
 *     void MyCallback2(void)
 *     {
 *       // this is invoked in the context of "srv" if "xyzEvent" occurrs in "srv".
 *     }
 * };
 * ~~~
 *
 * ## Thread safety
 * All registered callbacks are always invoked with the MultiCallback's mutex being locked. A callback therefore
 * must not invoke any method which locks the MultiCallback's mutex. Doing so would result in either a dead-lock
 * or an fatal error (e.g. panic) depending on the underlying mutex implementation. Most obviously these methods
 * are the MultiCallback's `Register()` and `Unregister()` methods.
 *
 * Not so obvious but also fatal are calls to the `Register()` and `Unregister()` methods of other MultiCallbacks
 * offered by the same server, which share one mutex (class [MultiCallbackSM](@ref gpcc::callback::MultiCallbackSM)).
 *
 * Less obvious are calls to API methods of the object that originally provided the callback (the server). These
 * calls might lead to invocation of `Notify()` of either the same MultiCallback (endless loop) or an MultiCallback
 * sharing the same mutex (dead lock or fatal error).
 *
 * The same type of problem may also occur if the callback invokes an API method of the server which attempts to
 * lock an internal mutex of the server, which is already locked by the server's code which originally executed
 * `Notify()`.
 *
 * Objects which provide events using [MultiCallback](@ref gpcc::callback::MultiCallback) and
 * [MultiCallbackSM](@ref gpcc::callback::MultiCallbackSM) should carefully document what the invoked callback is
 * allowed to do and what must not be done.
 *
 * __Often the best solution is to forbid the callback to invoke any API method of the server.__
 *
 * If the callback must perform non-trivial operations, clients should use an own execution context to process
 * the callback. This can be done by either using an own thread which is triggered by the callback or by enqueueing
 * an [WorkPackage](@ref gpcc::execution::async::WorkPackage) into a
 * [WorkQueue](@ref gpcc::execution::async::WorkQueue).
