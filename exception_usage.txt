Exception type               Usage/Example
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
std::exception               Base class for other exceptions only.
 |
 +-std::logic_error          Error in internal program logic (violation of precondition or class invariants).
 |  |                        Typically errors that could be prevented before program execution
 |  +-std::domain_error      Function not defined for input (e.g. passing negative number to square root).
 |  +-std::invalid_argument  Invalid argument passed to function.
 |  +-std::length_error      Attempt to create something greater than the specified maximum.
 |  +-std::out_of_range      Access out of array bounds.
 |
 +-std::runtime_error        Errors that can only be detected during run-time.
    |                        This is the opposite to logic_error which could be prevent before program execution.
    +-std::range_error       Range error in internal computation.
    +-std::overflow_error    Arithmethic overflow in internal computation. Maybe used instead of range_error.
    +-std::underflow_error   Arithmethic underflow in internal computation. E.g. result is too small for smallest
    |                        possible representation.
    +-std::system_error      Errors originating at operating system or other very-low-level-stuff
