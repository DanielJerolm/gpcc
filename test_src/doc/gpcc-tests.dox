/**
 * \defgroup GPCC_TESTS GPCC-tests
 * \brief Additional classes for the unittest target environment
 *
 * This group contains additional classes offered to clients in the unittest target environment only.\n
 * The classes in this group are not intended to be used in the productive target environment.\n
 * The classes offered in both the productive and the unittest target environment are [here](@ref GPCC).
 *
 * Examples:
 * - Classes assisting in unit testing, e.g. [Backend_Recorder](@ref gpcc_tests::log::Backend_Recorder).
 * - Fake implementations of classes from gpcc/src.
 *
 * When building GPCC for the unittest target environment, then the classes from this module will be compiled into
 * the library "gpcc" together with the [GPCC class collection](@ref GPCC).
 *
 * Use `#include <gpcc_test/xxx.hpp>` to include the headers.
