 *
 * \brief Classes for COOD remote access unit tests.
 *
 * # Unit test approach for classes realizing a RODA/RODAN interface pair
 * The [IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess](@ref gpcc::cood::IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess) and
 * [IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccessNotifiable](@ref gpcc::cood::IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccessNotifiable) interfaces
 * (abbreviated "RODA/RODAN") offer remote access to an object dictionary. See @ref GPCC_COOD_REMOTEACCESS_ITF for
 * details.
 *
 * GPCC offers a set of tests for a RODA/RODAN pair based on googletests' concept of "typed tests". The tests can be
 * applied to any class providing a RODA/RODAN pair in order to check the rules and concepts of the offered
 * [IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess](@ref gpcc::cood::IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess) and
 * [IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccessNotifiable](@ref gpcc::cood::IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccessNotifiable) interface
 * pair.
 *
 * The tests use the [IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess_TestsF](@ref gpcc_tests::cood::IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess_TestsF)
 * test fixture. It is contained in the file _TestIRODA.hpp_. The test cases are contained in the
 * _TestIRODA*.hpp_ files.
 *
 * For details on how to write test cases and how to apply tests to a UUT see
 * [IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess_TestsF](@ref gpcc_tests::cood::IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess_TestsF) for details.
 *
 * The type parameter __T__ of class
 * [IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess_TestsF](@ref gpcc_tests::cood::IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess_TestsF) does not refer
 * to the UUT itself (a class providing a RODA/RODAN pair), __but__ to a class providing a testbench __containing__ the
 * UUT.
 *
 * Any testbench class is derived from base class [TestbenchBase](@ref gpcc_tests::cood::TestbenchBase). Class
 * [TestbenchBase](@ref gpcc_tests::cood::TestbenchBase) provides some common functionality (e.g. log system, loggers,
 * some CANopen objects) and __acts as an interface__ for the testbench class. The test cases based on
 * [IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess_TestsF](@ref gpcc_tests::cood::IRemoteObjectDictionaryAccess_TestsF) can be applied
 * to any UUT that can be embedded in a testbench derived from class
 * [TestbenchBase](@ref gpcc_tests::cood::TestbenchBase).
 *
 * The figure below provides an example for unit-testing the
 * [ThreadBasedRemoteAccessServer](@ref gpcc::cood::ThreadBasedRemoteAccessServer):
 *
