/**
 * @ingroup GPCC_TESTS
 * @defgroup GPCC_TESTS_COMPILER Compiler (for unittest only)
 *
 * \brief Portable abstractions for compiler-specific stuff (for unittest only).
 *
 * This extends the abstractions for compiler-specific functions and key-words ([link](@ref GPCC_COMPILER)) by some more
 * abstractions dedicated to the unittest environment only:
 * - Temporary disabling of selected compiler warnings
 *
 * The abstractions provided here are available in the unittest environment only.
 *
 * # Usage
 * To access GPCC's compiler abstractions that are exclusive for the unittest environment, the appropriate header files
 * located in gpcc_test/compiler have to be included:
 * ~~~{.cpp}
 * #include <gpcc_test/compiler/warnings.hpp>
 * ~~~
 *
 * __Do not include headers from the subdirectorys of gpcc_test/compiler.__\n
 * The headers located in gpcc_test/compiler will include the required specific headers according to the compiler in use
 * and the configured CPU architecture.
