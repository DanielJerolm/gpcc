                             GPL Exception Text

  In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holder of the General
  Purpose Class Collection (GPCC), gives you the additional right to link the
  unmodified code of the GPCC (or parts of it) with code not covered under the
  GNU General Public License ("non-GPL code") and to distribute linked combinations
  including the two, without causing the resulting work to be covered by the
  GNU General Public License, subject to the limitations in this paragraph.

   1. Non-GPL code permitted under this exception must only link to the
      unmodified code of the General Purpose Class Collection (GPCC). The non-GPL code
      may include the unmodified headers and link to the unmodified files contained in the
      GPCC source code folder (gpcc/*.*).
   2. Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement
      that details to the recipient the version of the General Purpose Class Collection (GPCC)
      used and an offer by yourself to provide the General Purpose Class Collection (GPCC) source
      code should the recipient request it.

  You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all of the
  program code and other code used in conjunction with the program except the
  non-GPL code covered by this exception.
